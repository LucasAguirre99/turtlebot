# turtlebot
algo to turtlebot with a kinect

This code works with a robot called 'turtlebot,' which is powered by a Debian-Ubuntu operating system. We use ROS (Robot Operating System) to facilitate communication between the robot and the machine, and the code is written in Python. The robot is equipped with a Kinect, which we will use to avoid collisions.

The code 'alternative.py' must be run in the simulation environment or on the operating system that controls the robot. It uses various libraries that allow us to both obtain the camera image and perform distance calculations.
