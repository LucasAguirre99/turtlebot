# turtlebot
algo to turtlebot with a kinect

This code works with a robot called 'turtlebot,' which is powered by a Debian-Ubuntu operating system. We use ROS (Robot Operating System) to facilitate communication between the robot and the machine, and the code is written in Python. The robot is equipped with a Kinect, which we will use to avoid collisions.
